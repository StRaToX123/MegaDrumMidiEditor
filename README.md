# MegaDrumMidiEditor
Complementary app made to extend the functionality of the MegaDrum drumming module with an easy to use UI that lets you apply custom logic in order to remap, gate and <br />
edit MIDI notes in various ways. The user can monitor midi notes coming in from the MegaDrum module, group them via their family and name tags and apply filtering rules, <br />
which can retrigger other notes and rules, allowing for complex behaviour. All the notes created outputed by the app are sent over a virtual midi device which can be <br />
picked up inside of DAWs or other apps for further processing <br />
<br />
<br />
Each midi note has a monitor view (left side) and it's rules (right side).
A midi note has a family and a name tag. These can be set
